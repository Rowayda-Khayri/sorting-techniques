# sorting-techniques

 Program that compares between the following sort techniques: 1. Linear Sort, 2. Bubble Sort, and 3. Quick Sort.

The Comparisons is to be made for the following types of array (Random, Sorted, and Inversely
Sorted) and for different size of arrays.

The Program compares these techniques for the following comparison parameters:
• Relative run time
• Number of comparisons
• Number of interchanges of entries

Output of the program is:
=========================

• A table representing the results of comparison of the three sorting techniques and for
different array sizes.
• A graph representing these results.
• Simulation of sorting iterations. The simulation represents the numbers to be sorted
as lines (or bars) and the positions of these lines Change at each iteration.
